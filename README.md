# Predtweet
The goal of this repository is to predict how the temporal flow of tweets depends on external features such as world-wide news and tendencies within a given topic. We apply our prediction methods to a Twitter dataset filtered for Bitcoin related tweets (available at https://www.kaggle.com/alaix14/bitcoin-tweets-20160101-to-20190329)
